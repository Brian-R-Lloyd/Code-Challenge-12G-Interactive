12g Code Challenge

Hi Maxime,

Here is my solution to your Code Challenge.

I have sucessfully Tested in ie10, Firefox and Chrome.

I have found an issue with Safari. Setting the “animation-play-state” to pause causes the page to reload. I did find reference to this problem here: 

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14156523/safari-refreshes-the-page-on-setting-animation-play-state-to-paused

It appears to be the same problem as I checked my event viewer and it indicates it is WebKit2WebProcess.exe causing the problem.

Tested sucessfully on my Android phone in Firefox. I don't have access to an ipad/iphone but I did test in test sucessfully on iPad/peek.
